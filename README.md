## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository provides replication code and data for the paper:  
**_Dynamic Feature Selection for Canadian GDP Forecasting: Machine Learning with Google Trends and Official Data_**

The study combines traditional economic indicators with high-frequency Google Trends data using a novel dynamic feature selection approach with **PDC-SIS** and machine learning models to enhance the forecasting of monthly Canadian GDP.

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Installation

To run the notebooks, install the following required packages:

<pre>
<code>
!pip install dcor
!pip install git+https://github.com/Shafi2016/pypdc_sis.git
</code>
</pre>

These install the `dcor` library (for distance correlation) and the custom `pypdc_sis` library implementing the PDC-SIS feature selection method.

Additional commonly used packages may include:  
`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, and `catboost`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Machine Learning Models

- Random Forest (RF)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

Each model is evaluated using three data configurations:  
â†’ Google Trends only  
â†’ Official data only  
â†’ Combined data
